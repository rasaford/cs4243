# Assignment Instruction

Please use the same environment as in assignment 3 (do NOT create a new environment) and install an additional package `cyvlfeat` with running this command: 

	conda install -c menpo cyvlfeat

In this assignment, you are required to implement the key components of each step by filling the missing code segments in image_classification.py. You can edit image_classification.py with any editor/IDE (e.g. PyCharm) you are comfortable with. Before running the code segments, make sure the notebook are running in the virtual environment that you have set up. After you finish filling a code segment, make sure to save it before you run the related cells of this notebook (the notebook will automatically re-load your code in image_classification.py) to check if the results are correct.

# Submission Guideline

After you finish the code and get all the results, (1) re-run this notebook including the file check in the bottom (and make sure you get all the clean outputs), (2) zip the same folder (excluding the data folder) back and name it with your student ID (e.g. A0123456H.zip) and (3) submit to the NUS Luminus system (in time, before 23h59 on 10 Oct 2019). Please be careful since any failure to follow the submission guideline will result in a grade deduction.

Important node: 
(1) Do NOT to include the `data` directory when zipping and uploading
(2) Run the final code segment in the notebook to do a file check before submission

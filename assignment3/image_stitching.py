    Implement a simplifed version of Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).
    Paper reference: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf
    
    Your implementation does not need to exactly match the SIFT reference.
    Here are the key properties your (baseline) descriptor should have:
    (1) a 4x4 grid of cells, each length of 16/4=4. It is simply the
        terminology used in the feature literature to describe the spatial
        bins where gradient distributions will be described.
    (2) each cell should have a histogram of the local distribution of
        gradients in 8 orientations. Appending these histograms together will
        give you 4x4 x 8 = 128 dimensions.
    (3) Each feature should be normalized to unit length.

    You do not need to perform the interpolation in which each gradient
    measurement contributes to multiple orientation bins in multiple cells
    As described in Szeliski, a single gradient measurement creates a
    weighted contribution to the 4 nearest cells and the 2 nearest
    orientation bins within each cell, for 8 total contributions. This type
    of interpolation probably will help, though.

    You do not have to explicitly compute the gradient orientation at each
    pixel (although you are free to do so). You can instead filter with
    oriented filters (e.g. a filter that responds to edges with a specific
    orientation). All of your SIFT-like feature can be constructed entirely
    from filtering fairly quickly in this way.

    You do not need to do the normalize -> threshold -> normalize again
    operation as detailed in Szeliski and the SIFT paper. It can help, though.

    Another simple trick which can help is to raise each element of the final
    feature vector to some power that is less than one.
